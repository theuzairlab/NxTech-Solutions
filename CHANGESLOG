- Designed and implemented initial Prisma schema for core backend entities (users, services, industries, portfolio, case studies, testimonials, achievements/certifications, blog categories, blogs, team, contact submissions, and quote requests) backed by PostgreSQL.
- Validated Prisma schema via `npx prisma validate` to ensure relations and enums compile correctly.
- Integrated NextAuth with credential-based admin login, Prisma adapter usage, JWT sessions, secure cookies, middleware protection for dashboard routes, and an admin-only sign-in page.
 - Added Prisma seed script to create an initial admin user (admin@nts.com / Admin@123) via `npx prisma db seed`.

- Implemented public API endpoints for saving contact messages and quote requests to the database (`/api/contact-submissions` and `/api/quote-requests`) and wired the frontend `ContactForm` and `GetQuoteForm` components to use them.
- Added admin API endpoints to list and update statuses for contact submissions and quote requests under `/api/admin/contact-submissions` and `/api/admin/quote-requests`.
- Created a new dashboard Contacts page (`/dashboard/contacts`) with tabs for "Contact Messages" and "Quote Requests", including search, status filters, status updates, word-based previews for long text, detail modals, and shadcn data-table layouts, and integrated it into the admin sidebar navigation.
- Updated the home page `ServicesSnapshot` section to load main services dynamically from the database (matching the services page query), using service slugs, images, icons, and short descriptions for the cards.
- Updated the home page `IndustriesServe` section to read industries from the database, show only the top 10 industries, enlarge the flip cards, and display top pain points and solutions on the back similar to the services industries section.
- Integrated AI chatbot functionality using OpenRouter API (OpenAI-compatible) in the live chat widget. The chatbot can answer FAQs, collect leads (saved to new `ChatLead` table), recommend services with clickable links, and provide Calendly meeting booking. Added `/api/chatbot` endpoint that uses company services and industries data from the database to provide contextual responses. Updated `live-chat-widget.tsx` to call the backend API, display service recommendations as interactive buttons, and show a "Book a Meeting" button that opens Calendly in an embedded modal within the chat widget. Added `CalendlyEmbed` component to the contact page below the get quote form. The chatbot no longer shows raw Calendly URLs but instead displays a button that opens the scheduling interface without leaving the chat. Improved JSON extraction to handle multiple JSON objects in AI responses (for lead creation and meeting booking). Enhanced welcome message to inform users about chatbot capabilities (answering questions, arranging meetings, providing information, getting quotes, recommending services). Added quick action buttons for common tasks (Our Services, Book Meeting, Get Quote) that appear below the welcome message. Made the chatbot fully responsive for all screen sizes: mobile (full-width with adjusted spacing), tablet (optimized sizing), and desktop (fixed positioning). Chat window adapts from full-screen on mobile to fixed-size on larger screens. Calendly modal is full-screen on mobile and centered modal on desktop. All text sizes, padding, and interactive elements scale appropriately across breakpoints. Made the WhatsApp button component fully responsive for small screens: button size adapts from `w-14 h-14` on mobile to `w-16 h-16` on larger screens, modal expands to full-width on mobile (`w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`) with responsive padding and text sizes, positioning adjusted to avoid overlap with chat widget on mobile (`bottom-4 right-4` on mobile, `bottom-6 right-6` on larger screens). Made all rounded corners responsive across the entire application: standard rounded corners (`rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`) now scale from `rounded-lg`/`rounded-xl` on mobile to full size on desktop, large section rounded corners (`rounded-b-[150px]`, `rounded-b-[200px]`) now scale from `rounded-b-[50px]` on mobile to `rounded-b-[100px]` on tablet to full size on desktop, applied to all section components (services, industries, portfolio, blog, contact, testimonials, achievements, etc.), cards, modals, forms, and UI components. This ensures a more polished and appropriate appearance on small screens while maintaining the modern aesthetic on larger displays. Made the services page hero section (`ServicesHero`) fully responsive: canvas height adapts to viewport height (max 700px), heading scales from `text-3xl` on mobile to `text-7xl` on desktop, description text scales appropriately with responsive padding, feature badges have smaller padding and text on mobile with better spacing, CTA buttons are full-width on mobile and auto-width on larger screens with responsive text and padding, stats grid maintains 2-column layout on mobile and 4-column on desktop with responsive text sizes, gradient orbs scale from `w-48 h-48` on mobile to `w-96 h-96` on desktop, grid pattern scales from 30px on mobile to 50px on desktop, section padding adjusts from `py-12` on mobile to `py-20` on desktop. Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- Made all admin dashboard pages and components fully responsive for small screens: Updated main dashboard page grid layout to stack on mobile, made all management components (achievements, blogs, contacts, industries, portfolios, services, settings, testimonials, users) responsive with flex layouts that stack on mobile, search inputs and buttons that are full-width on mobile, responsive text sizes (text-xs on mobile scaling to text-sm/text-base on larger screens), responsive grid layouts (1 column on mobile, 2-3 columns on larger screens), responsive card padding and spacing, made tables horizontally scrollable on mobile with proper min-widths, updated tabs component to be full-width on mobile with responsive text sizes, ensured all badges, buttons, and icons scale appropriately for small screens, improved spacing and gaps throughout all components for better mobile experience.
