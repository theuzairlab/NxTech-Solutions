- Applied consistent animated background from Services page hero section to all mainRoutes pages (home, about, contact, blog). All hero sections now feature: canvas-based particle animation system (80 particles with smooth movement), animated grid pattern overlay, and animated gradient orbs with floating animation. The animation is lightweight, smooth, and consistent across all pages. Updated contact and blog hero sections to use the same light background gradient (from-primary/20 via-background to-primary/10) as other pages instead of the primary color background, ensuring visual consistency. Changed particle colors, grid patterns, and gradient orbs to use teal/primary colors across all pages. Updated text colors in contact and blog hero sections to match the light background theme (foreground and muted-foreground instead of white).
- Fixed Our Process section on About Us page: Increased icon size from w-14 h-14 to w-20 h-20 (sm:w-24 sm:h-24) with icon size increased from h-7 w-7 to h-10 w-10 (sm:h-12 sm:w-12) for better visibility. Improved spacing between cards from gap-6 to gap-8 lg:gap-10, increased spacing around icons (mb-4 to mb-6), and increased step number spacing (mb-4 to mb-6). Fixed text color issues: Changed description text from text-white to text-muted-foreground for better readability before hover, ensuring text is clearly visible and matches NXTech branding. Added dark gradient overlay (from-card/95 via-card/70 to-transparent) for better text contrast. Improved process flow visualization with larger step circles (w-12 h-12 to w-14 h-14) and better spacing (gap-4 to gap-6 lg:gap-8). All text now has proper contrast and is readable without relying on hover states.
- Completely redesigned Our Process section to match vertical timeline infographic style: Changed from grid layout to vertical timeline with alternating left/right positioning. Each step now features: large rounded rectangular containers with teal gradient backgrounds (from-[#00c2c7] to darker shades), white circular icon containers with shadows, white text for titles and descriptions ensuring perfect readability, step numbers displayed as "STEP 01", "STEP 02", etc. in primary color, vertical dotted line connecting all steps, connection point circles on the timeline. Steps alternate positioning (even steps on right, odd steps on left) for visual interest. Removed image backgrounds and replaced with solid gradient backgrounds for better text contrast. All text is now white on colored backgrounds, ensuring maximum readability. Icons are prominently displayed in white circles with proper sizing (w-20 h-20 sm:w-24 sm:h-24). Improved spacing and visual hierarchy throughout.
- Updated Get Quote Form to show success popup/modal instead of replacing entire section: Changed form behavior so that when submitted, the form is hidden (opacity-30, pointer-events-none) and a modal popup appears with the success message. The modal features: fixed overlay with backdrop blur, centered modal with gradient background (teal colors), all content centered for better visual appeal, success icon with glow effect (white circle with backdrop blur and shadow), "Thank You!" heading, centered confirmation message, close button in top-right, and centered "Submit Another Request" button. Added smooth animations (fade-in, zoom-in) for better UX. Improved icon styling with outer glow effect and better visual hierarchy. The form remains visible but dimmed in the background, and users can close the modal to reset and submit another request.
- Redesigned Services Industries section with improved UI styling and text visibility: Changed from image-overlay design to card-based layout with image section on top and content section below for better readability. Added dark gradient overlay (from-black/80 via-black/40 to-black/20) on images to ensure white text is always clearly visible. Improved hover effects with card lift animation (hover:-translate-y-2), enhanced shadows (hover:shadow-2xl), and accent line animation. Better text contrast with larger, bolder headings, improved spacing, and icon badges with colored backgrounds. Enhanced visual hierarchy with section separators, better padding, and organized content layout. Added smooth transitions and hover states for all interactive elements. Cards now have white background for content section ensuring perfect text readability at all times.
- Redesigned Additional Services section with attractive UI styling: Enhanced header section with badge, improved typography with gradient text, and better spacing. Improved auto-scrolling cards with larger size (300-320px width), better image section with dark overlay for text contrast, white content section for readability, hover lift animation (hover:-translate-y-2), enhanced shadows (hover:shadow-2xl), accent line animation, and "Learn More" call-to-action with arrow icon. Redesigned grid cards with card-based layout (image on top, content below), dark gradient overlay on images for white text visibility, service name badge overlay on images, hover effects with card lift and enhanced shadows, smooth transitions, and "Explore Service" call-to-action.

- Designed and implemented initial Prisma schema for core backend entities (users, services, industries, portfolio, case studies, testimonials, achievements/certifications, blog categories, blogs, team, contact submissions, and quote requests) backed by PostgreSQL.
- Validated Prisma schema via `npx prisma validate` to ensure relations and enums compile correctly.
- Integrated NextAuth with credential-based admin login, Prisma adapter usage, JWT sessions, secure cookies, middleware protection for dashboard routes, and an admin-only sign-in page.
 - Added Prisma seed script to create an initial admin user (admin@nts.com / Admin@123) via `npx prisma db seed`.

- Implemented public API endpoints for saving contact messages and quote requests to the database (`/api/contact-submissions` and `/api/quote-requests`) and wired the frontend `ContactForm` and `GetQuoteForm` components to use them.
- Added admin API endpoints to list and update statuses for contact submissions and quote requests under `/api/admin/contact-submissions` and `/api/admin/quote-requests`.
- Created a new dashboard Contacts page (`/dashboard/contacts`) with tabs for "Contact Messages" and "Quote Requests", including search, status filters, status updates, word-based previews for long text, detail modals, and shadcn data-table layouts, and integrated it into the admin sidebar navigation.
- Updated the home page `ServicesSnapshot` section to load main services dynamically from the database (matching the services page query), using service slugs, images, icons, and short descriptions for the cards.
- Updated the home page `IndustriesServe` section to read industries from the database, show only the top 10 industries, enlarge the flip cards, and display top pain points and solutions on the back similar to the services industries section.
- Integrated AI chatbot functionality using OpenRouter API (OpenAI-compatible) in the live chat widget. The chatbot can answer FAQs, collect leads (saved to new `ChatLead` table), recommend services with clickable links, and provide Calendly meeting booking. Added `/api/chatbot` endpoint that uses company services and industries data from the database to provide contextual responses. Updated `live-chat-widget.tsx` to call the backend API, display service recommendations as interactive buttons, and show a "Book a Meeting" button that opens Calendly in an embedded modal within the chat widget. Added `CalendlyEmbed` component to the contact page below the get quote form. The chatbot no longer shows raw Calendly URLs but instead displays a button that opens the scheduling interface without leaving the chat. Improved JSON extraction to handle multiple JSON objects in AI responses (for lead creation and meeting booking). Enhanced welcome message to inform users about chatbot capabilities (answering questions, arranging meetings, providing information, getting quotes, recommending services). Added quick action buttons for common tasks (Our Services, Book Meeting, Get Quote) that appear below the welcome message. Made the chatbot fully responsive for all screen sizes: mobile (full-width with adjusted spacing), tablet (optimized sizing), and desktop (fixed positioning). Chat window adapts from full-screen on mobile to fixed-size on larger screens. Calendly modal is full-screen on mobile and centered modal on desktop. All text sizes, padding, and interactive elements scale appropriately across breakpoints. Made the WhatsApp button component fully responsive for small screens: button size adapts from `w-14 h-14` on mobile to `w-16 h-16` on larger screens, modal expands to full-width on mobile (`w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`) with responsive padding and text sizes, positioning adjusted to avoid overlap with chat widget on mobile (`bottom-4 right-4` on mobile, `bottom-6 right-6` on larger screens). Made all rounded corners responsive across the entire application: standard rounded corners (`rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`) now scale from `rounded-lg`/`rounded-xl` on mobile to full size on desktop, large section rounded corners (`rounded-b-[150px]`, `rounded-b-[200px]`) now scale from `rounded-b-[50px]` on mobile to `rounded-b-[100px]` on tablet to full size on desktop, applied to all section components (services, industries, portfolio, blog, contact, testimonials, achievements, etc.), cards, modals, forms, and UI components. This ensures a more polished and appropriate appearance on small screens while maintaining the modern aesthetic on larger displays. Made the services page hero section (`ServicesHero`) fully responsive: canvas height adapts to viewport height (max 700px), heading scales from `text-3xl` on mobile to `text-7xl` on desktop, description text scales appropriately with responsive padding, feature badges have smaller padding and text on mobile with better spacing, CTA buttons are full-width on mobile and auto-width on larger screens with responsive text and padding, stats grid maintains 2-column layout on mobile and 4-column on desktop with responsive text sizes, gradient orbs scale from `w-48 h-48` on mobile to `w-96 h-96` on desktop, grid pattern scales from 30px on mobile to 50px on desktop, section padding adjusts from `py-12` on mobile to `py-20` on desktop. Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- Made all admin dashboard pages and components fully responsive for small screens: Updated main dashboard page grid layout to stack on mobile, made all management components (achievements, blogs, contacts, industries, portfolios, services, settings, testimonials, users) responsive with flex layouts that stack on mobile, search inputs and buttons that are full-width on mobile, responsive text sizes (text-xs on mobile scaling to text-sm/text-base on larger screens), responsive grid layouts (1 column on mobile, 2-3 columns on larger screens), responsive card padding and spacing, made tables horizontally scrollable on mobile with proper min-widths, updated tabs component to be full-width on mobile with responsive text sizes, ensured all badges, buttons, and icons scale appropriately for small screens, improved spacing and gaps throughout all components for better mobile experience.
- Fixed TypeScript build errors in admin API routes: Added proper type validation for status query parameters in `/api/admin/contact-submissions` and `/api/admin/quote-requests` routes. Status parameters are now validated against valid enum values before being used in Prisma queries, preventing type errors while maintaining full functionality. Invalid status values are safely ignored and the query proceeds without the status filter.
- Fixed TypeScript build error in hero-section component: Resolved "canvas is possibly null" error by passing canvas dimensions (width and height) as parameters to the Particle constructor instead of accessing canvas from outer scope. This ensures type safety while maintaining full functionality.
- Fixed Next.js Suspense boundary errors: Wrapped components using `useSearchParams()` in Suspense boundaries to comply with Next.js requirements. Updated `/auth` page and `/dashboard/contacts` page to properly handle client-side search params with Suspense fallbacks, ensuring successful production builds without affecting functionality.
- Improved chatbot service display: Updated chatbot to display services as user-friendly clickable cards instead of numbered text lists. When users ask for "all services", the chatbot now automatically returns all service slugs which are displayed as a scrollable grid of interactive cards with hover effects. Each service card shows the formatted service name and links directly to the service page. Updated system prompt to instruct AI to use recommend_services action when listing all services, and added fallback detection to automatically include all services if user asks for them but AI doesn't include the action.
- Enhanced chatbot message formatting: All chatbot AI responses now display in an attractive, formatted view using ReactMarkdown. Bot messages feature improved typography with proper spacing, formatted lists (bullets and numbered), bold/italic text support, code blocks, blockquotes, and better visual hierarchy. Bot message bubbles now have a subtle gradient background (from-white to-primary/5) with enhanced shadows and borders. User messages maintain their primary color styling. All text is properly sized and spaced for better readability on both mobile and desktop. The chatbot now provides a more professional and visually appealing conversation experience.
- Fixed JSON display in chatbot responses: Improved JSON extraction logic to completely remove JSON action objects from displayed text. Enhanced the findJsonObjects function to properly handle nested arrays and objects. Added multiple cleanup passes (server-side and client-side) to ensure no JSON artifacts appear in user-facing messages. Updated system prompt to instruct AI to place JSON actions on separate lines. Bot responses now show clean, readable text without any JSON code, while service recommendations are displayed as interactive cards separately.
